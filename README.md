## Deploy on Netlify


**1.Manual Drag-and-Drop Deployment:**
This is a simple option for projects that are not under version control. You can navigate to the Netlify app and drag your project folder into the designated drop zone. Netlify will then handle the build and deployment process.

**2.Git-Based Deployment:** This is the recommended approach for most projects, especially those under version control with Git. Here's a general procedure:

Create a Netlify Account and Connect to Git: Sign up for a Netlify account and link it to your Git provider (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).

**3.Add a New Site:**
In the Netlify app, initiate the process of adding a new site.

Select your Git Repository: Choose the repository containing your project code.

**4.Configure Build Settings (if necessary):**
Netlify will attempt to automatically detect build commands based on your project framework. You can review and adjust these settings if needed.

**5.Deploy Your Site:** 
Netlify will initiate a build process based on your configuration and deploy your project to a live URL.
